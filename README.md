In the daily planner, I created a simple calendar planning product that aligns with the user story. Upon opening the planner, the current day takes center stage at the top of the calendar.

 As you scroll down, you'll find time blocks laid out for standard business hours, spanning from 9 am to 5 pm. To enhance the planning experience, I made sure time block dynamically adopts a color-coded scheme, distinguishing whether it's in the past, present, or future. 


By clicking into a time block, the user can add anything into their schedule and use the save icon on the right, where the information will be locally stored. After the page is refreshed or left, the saved information will remain since it's stored locally. 

Here is a link to the live server of the finished product https://egamer13.github.io/Becks-calendar/

I have also included two screenshots of the finished product.
